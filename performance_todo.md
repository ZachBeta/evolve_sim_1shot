# Performance Optimization TODO List

## Phase 1: Diagnosis

- [ ] Install profiling tools
  - [ ] `go install github.com/google/pprof@latest`
- [ ] Run simulation with CPU profiling
  - [ ] `go run -cpuprofile=cpu.prof main.go`
- [ ] Analyze CPU profile
  - [ ] `go tool pprof cpu.prof`
  - [ ] Identify top CPU consumers
  - [ ] Note functions with highest cumulative time
- [ ] Check for common bottlenecks
  - [ ] Identify excessive logging in hot paths
  - [ ] Find frequent concentration grid recalculations
  - [ ] Look for lock contention in UpdateChemicalSources
  - [ ] Identify expensive per-frame calculations

## Phase 2: Remove Debug Logging

- [ ] Edit `pkg/world/world.go`:
  - [ ] Remove debug prints from `DepleteEnergyFromSourcesAt`
  - [ ] Remove debug prints from `UpdateChemicalSources`
  - [ ] Remove counter variables (`depletionCounter`, `updateCounter`)
  - [ ] Check for other unnecessary logging
- [ ] Edit `pkg/types/chemical_source.go`:
  - [ ] Remove debug prints from `Update` method
  - [ ] Clean up any other debug prints

## Phase 3: Optimize Concentration Grid

- [ ] Edit `pkg/world/world.go`:
  - [ ] Increase grid resolution for better performance:
    - [ ] Change `InitializeConcentrationGrid(5.0)` to `InitializeConcentrationGrid(10.0)`
  - [ ] Modify grid invalidation logic:
    - [ ] Add energy change threshold before invalidating grid
    - [ ] Implement dirty region tracking for grid
  - [ ] Add early exit optimization for concentration calculations:
    - [ ] Skip concentration calculations for distant sources

## Phase 4: Reduce Lock Contention

- [ ] Edit `pkg/world/world.go`:
  - [ ] Audit all mutex usages
  - [ ] Replace global mutex with finer-grained locks where possible
  - [ ] Implement read/write locks where appropriate
  - [ ] Reduce critical section sizes in hot functions
  - [ ] Batch updates to minimize lock acquisitions

## Phase 5: Optimize Chemical Source Updates

- [ ] Implement update frequency optimization:
  - [ ] Add update interval parameter to config
  - [ ] Skip updates for some sources based on distance/priority
- [ ] Implement spatial partitioning:
  - [ ] Design partition grid structure
  - [ ] Modify source lookup for better performance
  - [ ] Implement efficient neighbor search
- [ ] Add early-exit optimizations:
  - [ ] Skip far-away sources in concentration calculations
  - [ ] Implement distance-based culling for updates

## Phase 6: Implement Lazy Evaluation

- [ ] Add dirty flag system:
  - [ ] Track which regions need recalculation
  - [ ] Only update concentration grid in dirty regions
- [ ] Optimize inactive source handling:
  - [ ] Separate active and inactive source lists
  - [ ] Skip inactive sources in concentration calculations
- [ ] Implement efficient data structures:
  - [ ] Use spatial hashmap for faster lookups
  - [ ] Consider object pooling to reduce allocations

## Phase 7: Advanced Optimizations

- [ ] Implement multi-threading:
  - [ ] Identify parallelizable calculations
  - [ ] Add worker pool for independent operations
  - [ ] Ensure thread safety with proper synchronization
- [ ] Optimize memory usage:
  - [ ] Reduce unnecessary allocations in hot paths
  - [ ] Consider custom allocators for frequent operations
  - [ ] Use sync.Pool for temporary objects
- [ ] Profile and optimize rendering:
  - [ ] Optimize visualization code
  - [ ] Add render culling for offscreen elements

## Phase 8: Testing and Measurement

- [ ] Measure baseline performance:
  - [ ] Record current FPS
  - [ ] Generate baseline CPU profile
- [ ] After each optimization:
  - [ ] Run with the same test conditions
  - [ ] Measure FPS improvement
  - [ ] Generate new CPU profile
  - [ ] Compare with baseline
  - [ ] Document improvements
- [ ] Final comprehensive testing:
  - [ ] Test with various simulation sizes
  - [ ] Test with different configuration settings
  - [ ] Generate performance report

## Phase 9: Configuration Tweaks

- [ ] Edit `config.json`:
  - [ ] Adjust chemical count if necessary
  - [ ] Fine-tune depletionRate
  - [ ] Optimize regenerationProbability
  - [ ] Consider disabling showConcentration for performance
  - [ ] Consider disabling showGrid for performance
- [ ] Create performance presets:
  - [ ] Low (max performance, less accuracy)
  - [ ] Medium (balanced)
  - [ ] High (max accuracy, less performance)

## Final Verification

- [ ] Run final profiling session
- [ ] Compare with initial profile
- [ ] Document all optimizations and their impact
- [ ] Update documentation with performance recommendations
