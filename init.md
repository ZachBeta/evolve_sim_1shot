I've seen a lot of evolutionary simulators over the years
from conway's game of life
to evolutionary neural networks - with predator prey simulations that use neural networks to define the behavior of the entities
there's a lot of ways this can go
after a lot of agent driven prototypes, I'm a bit concerned about faillig into the same traps
I'd like a simulator simple enough to run and be stable and well designed enough to add more
We should follow design patterns, best practices, and architectures that can help us grow the software functionality without ending up chasing test failures.
