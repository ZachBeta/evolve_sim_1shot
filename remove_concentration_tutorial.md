# Remove Concentration Functionality - Tutorial Checklist

## Overview
This tutorial will guide you through removing the concentration grid functionality from the simulation as it's slow and not essential for core gameplay. By eliminating this feature, we'll improve performance and simplify the codebase.

## Steps

### 1. Understand Concentration Usage
- [ ] Review how ConcentrationGrid is used in the World
- [ ] Identify which organism behaviors depend on concentration
- [ ] Note which visualization features use concentration data

### 2. Modify Concentration Grid
- [ ] Keep the ConcentrationGrid struct but simplify its implementation
- [ ] Modify GetConcentrationAt to return minimal data
- [ ] Update GetGradientAt to return sensible default values

### 3. Update Organism Behavior
- [ ] Update organism movement/behavior to not rely on concentration gradients
- [ ] Simplify sensor functionality to work without detailed concentration data
- [ ] Ensure organisms can still navigate toward chemical sources directly

### 4. Update Renderer
- [ ] Disable drawChemicalConcentration method
- [ ] Remove concentration visualization code
- [ ] Remove concentration legend rendering

### 5. Update Configuration
- [ ] Set ShowConcentration to false by default
- [ ] Consider removing the option entirely if no longer needed

### 6. Clean Up UI Elements
- [ ] Remove concentration toggle key (C)
- [ ] Update help text and controls documentation
- [ ] Remove legend display related to concentration

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Run the simulation to verify it still works without concentration grid
- [ ] Check that performance has improved
- [ ] Ensure organisms still behave in a meaningful way

## Expected Benefits
- ✅ Significantly improved performance
- ✅ Reduced memory usage
- ✅ Simplified codebase
- ✅ More focused simulation behavior

## Notes
If the concentration grid is deeply integrated with the simulation:
1. Consider implementing a simplified placeholder that provides basic functionality
2. Prioritize making organisms function without detailed gradient information
3. Keep a minimal API surface to avoid breaking many dependencies
